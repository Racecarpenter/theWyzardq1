# theWyzardq1
Quarter 1 project
For this Project, I have created a search engine that will be able to return short answers to historical questions.

In order to do this, I used a Wolfram|Alpha API, with a specific endpoint of the Short Answer API.
I also had to download the google chrome extension CORS Allow-Control-Allow-Origin and have it enabled to make the request.

This extension will prevent you from logging on to Github, so make sure it is turned off after use of this API.

The Wyzard love History, and because he loves it so much he has decided to tell you small bits of information that you ask for.

There are also About, Contact, and Copyright links with INFO about the "Wyzard"
