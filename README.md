# theWyzardq1
Quarter 1 project

For this Project, I have created a search engine that will be able to return short answers to historical questions.

In order to do this, I used a Wolfram|Alpha API, with a specific endpoint of the Short Answer API.
I also had to download the google chrome extension CORS Allow-Control-Allow-Origin and have it enabled to make the request.

The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) mechanism gives web servers cross-domain access controls, which enable secure cross-domain data transfers

This extension will prevent you from logging on to Github(Or playing Videos on Youtube) so make sure it is turned off after use of this site.

The Wyzard loves History, and because he loves it so much he has decided to tell you small bits of information that you ask for.

---------------------------------------------------------

While talking to the Wyzard, try to avoid asking questions that aren't specific or quantifiable. For example: If you asked the Wyzard, "Who made the first computer?", the Wyzard would say "Charles Babbage." However, if you asked the Wyzard "Who was Charles Babbage?" the Wyzard would say "Charles Babbage."
The reason for this redundancy is not because the Wyzard wishes to mock you, but because there is nothing specifically quantifiable about who Charles Babbage was. But ask when he was born, when he died, what his height was etc. you will get an answer.
